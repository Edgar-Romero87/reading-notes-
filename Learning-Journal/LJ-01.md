* PHP is an interpreted language, when you make changes t o your source code you can immediatley test these changes without first needing to compile your source code into binary form. This makes the development process much faster.

* PHP code is enclosed between the ``` <?php ?> ``` tags and can be embedded into HTML.

## Installation and Use
