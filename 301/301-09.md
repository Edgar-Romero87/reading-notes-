# Concepts of Functional Programming in JavaScript

* Functional programming is a proframming paradigm-- a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs-- that treats the computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

* What makes a function pure?
 - If it returns the same result if given the same arguments (a.k.a deterministic)
 - It does not cause any observable side effects.

- If a function reads external files it is not a PURE FUNCTION.
- Any function that relies on a random number generator cannot be pure.
* When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it's created. You cannot change an immutable object, instead you have to create a new object with a new value.

* pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency
