# SQL

* SQL (Structured Query Language), is a language desinged to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. 
* A relational database represents a colection of realted (2d) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an excel spreadsheet, with a fized number of named columns and any numbers of rows of data.

* To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write **SELECT** statements, which are reffered to as queries. A query in itself is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned. 
* Select query for a specific column `SELECT column FROM mytable;`
* Select query for all columns `SELECT * FROM mytable;`

* In order to filter certain results from being returned, we need to use a **WHERE** clause in the query. The clause is applied to each row of data by checking specific column values to detirmine whether it should be included or not.

* More complex clauses can be constructed by joining numerous **AND** or **OR** logival keywords.
