* When grid-column-start is used alone, the grid item by default will span exactly one column. However, you can extend the item across multiple columns by adding the grid-column-end property.

* If you want to count grid lines from the right instead of the left, you can give grid-column-start and grid-column-end negative values.

* Instead of defining a grid item based on the start and end positions of the grid lines, you can define it based on your desired column width using the span keyword. Keep in mind that span only works with positive values.

* You can also use the span keyword with grid-column-start to set your item's width relative to the end position.

* Typing both grid-column-start and grid-column-end every time can get tiring. Fortunately, grid-column is a shorthand property that can accept both values at once, separated by a slash.

* One of the things that sets CSS grids apart from flexbox is that you can easily position items in two dimensions: columns and rows. grid-row-start works much like grid-column-start except along the vertical axis.


* If typing out both grid-column and grid-row is too much for you, there's yet another shorthand for that. grid-area accepts four values separated by slashes: grid-row-start, grid-column-start, grid-row-end, followed by grid-column-end.
AN example of this would be grid-area: 1 / 1 / 3 / 6;
