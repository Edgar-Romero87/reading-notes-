# Heroku
* To create an app to Heroku start with the `heroku create` command.
* To deploy the app use the command `git push heroku master`
* Shortcut to open newly deployed app `heroku open`.
*Heroku treats logs as streams of time-ordered events aggregated from the output streams of all your app and Heroku components, providing a single channel for all of the events.

View information about your running app using one of the logging commands, `heroku logs --tail:`
* Press `Control+C` to stop streaming the logs.
*Heroku apps include a Procfile that specifies the commands that are executed by the app on startup. You can use a Procfile to declare a variety of process types, including:

  - Your appâ€™s web server
  - Multiple types of worker processes
  - A singleton process, such as a clock
  - Tasks to run before a new release is deployed
