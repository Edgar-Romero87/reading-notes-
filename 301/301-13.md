### Sending Form Data
* A client sends a request to a server using the HTTP protocol. The server answers the request using the same protocol. This is the client/server architecture.

* The `<form>` element defines how the data will be sent. 
* The `action` attribute defines where the data gets sent. Its value must be a valid relative or absolute URL. If this attribute isn't provided, the data will be sent to the URL of the page conraining the form.
* The `method` attribute defines how data is sent, the most common methods are `GET` and `POST`.
  - **GET** method is used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource. 
  - **POST** method is used by the browser to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request.
* To View HTTP Request:
  1. Open the developer tools.
  1. Select "Network"
  1. Select "All"
  1. Select "foo.com" in the "Name" tab
  1. Select "Headers"
