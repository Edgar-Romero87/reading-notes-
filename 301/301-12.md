## EJS Partials

* Partials are reusable bundles of code that make large websites easier to maintain.
` <%-include(partial/onpartial)%>`

* Partials are native to EJS
  - You use them for a nav bar, footer, or reusable, static pieces of text.

* Using partials will make your code cleaner and also life easier as you don't have to add a bunch of CSS links to every page, or keep putting a nav bar on every page.
