# REST

* Rest stands for REPRESENTATIONAL STATE TRANSFER and is a software architectural  style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. 

* HTTP tells the browser what protocol to use, and is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world.

* A web page is a representation of a resource. Resources are just concepts like URLs. URLs tell the browser there is a concept somewhere. A browser than can go ask for a specific representation of the concept.

* Systems retrieve info from each other using a simple HTTP GET. If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP POST. If a system wants to replace something in another system it uses an HTTP PUT or, to do a partial update it will use a PATCH.
