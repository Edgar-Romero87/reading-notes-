# Redux Asychronous Actions

1. How granular should your reducers be?
2. Pro or Con – multiple reducers can “fire” when a commonly named action is dispatched
    - CON because code is no longer purely a function of its inputs, and the interactions with the outside world are known as “side effects”
3. Name a strategy for preventing the above
  - add the Redux Thunk middleware that lets you write action creators with more complex and asynchronous logic. Another widely-used method is Redux Saga which lets you write more synchronous-looking code using generators, and can act like “background threads” or “daemons” in a Redux app.


## Terms 
* store
  - A store holds the whole state tree of your application. The only way to change the state inside it is to dispatch an action on it.
* combined reducers
  - helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore.
