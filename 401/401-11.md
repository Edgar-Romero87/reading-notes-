# Authentication

#### User Modeling
* You need user models to store user's sensitive information so they can trust your application.

* In a User model, a hash password can be stored when the user signs up. When the user needs to login, they can resend their password and the server can hash the login password using the same hash algorithm. The server can then compare the hashed login password with previously stored hashed password to determine if the user should be authenticated.

#### Cryptography
* The science which studies methods for encoding messages so that they can only be read by a person who knows the secret information for deconding, called the kep.

* Cryptanalysis: the science of decoding encrypted messages without possessing the proper key, and has several other branches.

#### Hash Algorithms
* A cryptographic hash algortithm takes a piece of data and produces a hash that is deliberatley difficult to reverse.

* Hash algorithms are often used for checking the integrity of data.

#### Cypher Algorithms

* Cryptographic Cypher Algorithms take a piece of data and a key and produces encrypted data. Later the encrypted data can be reversed into the original data by decrypting it using the same key.
