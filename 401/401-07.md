# Express

### Express Routing

* Express driven System
  - ``` app.get('/thing', (req, res) => ()) ```
  - When a get event happens in our server the '/thing' run this function

  ### Express Middleware
  * Middleware is a series of functions that the express 'goes through'
  * Each function recieves a request, response and next as params.
* Application Middleware
  - Error Handlers
  - bringing in other routes
  - Applying Defaults
  - JSON, Body and Form Parsing
  - Run on every request
* Route Middleware
  - Deals with things specific to a route
  - Are you logged in? What is your IP? HAve we Seen you here before?

### CRUD ROUTES 

*  Create = app.post('/thing')
* Read = app.get('resource')
* Update = app.put('/resource/:id')
* Destroy = app.get('/resource/:id')

### TESTING
* Avoid starting the server for testing, instead export server as a module in a library then use ***supertest*** to run tests.
  - This hit your routes as though the server was running without actually starting it.
  
  EX.)
  ```
  const request = require('supertest');
  const express = require('express');

  const app = express();

  app.get('/user', function(req, res) {
    res.status(200).json({ name: 'john' });
  });

  request(app)
    .get('/user')
    .expect('Content-Type', /json/)
    .expect('Content-Length', '15')
    .expect(200)
    .end(function(err, res) {
      if (err) throw err;
   });

  ```
