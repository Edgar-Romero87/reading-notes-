# Event Driven Apllications

## Research
1. Why is access control important?
- It keeps users from accessing information that is not meant for them. "If authentication is a lock on the main door of the hotel, then access control is the individual access card they give to each user for accessing their room."

2. Describe an application that would need access control.
- An application that keeps track of employee work times and attendance.
3. What is a role used for?
-  Operational privileges are grouped into roles and each user is assigned a role. The role, instead of the individual, is the basis for access checks

4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
- You can change access allowances based on role of the user.

## VOCAB

* Authorization
  - authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to.

* Role Based Access Control 
 - a method of restricting network access based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. RBAC lets employees have access rights only to the information they need to do their jobs and prevents them from accessing information that doesn't pertain to them.

* Capabilities
  - the power or ability to do something.
