* global state
  - 
* global context
  - What it means is that, there has not been any object defined which contains the keyword this. In such a case, this keyword refers to the global object.
* provider  
  - The provider is a component which enables the Consumers to subscribe to the context changes. The provider accepts a value prop and the data in this prop is available to all the child consumers.

* consumer
  - The consumer is a getter of context. The components can subscribe to context values by wrapping the Consumer around it. Consumer needs a method with a parameter which returns a react node and composes with the app.
