# Data Modeling & NoSQL Databases

## Reading, Research and Discussion

1. Why would a developer choose to make data models?
 A data model provides a focus for determining scope. It provides something tangible to help business sponsors and developers agree over precisely what is included with the software and what is omitted. Business staff can see what the developers are building and compare it with their understanding. Models promote consensus among developers, customers and other stakeholders.

1. What purpose do CRUD operations serve?
  CRUD makes it so a model can Create, Read, Update and Delete resources. A model should have the ability to perform at most these four functions in order to be complete.

1. What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?
Postgres is a **relational** database that is table based, uses a structured query language and has a predefined schema.
MongoDB is a **Non-relational** database, it has dynamic schemas for unstructured data.

1. What is Mongoose and why do we need it?
Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.

1. Define three related pieces of data in a possible application. An example for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each Product has a Category and belongs in a Department.
An example for a 

## Vocabulary

* database: A place where you can save data, even if your server shuts down or machine turns off.
* data model: Somethinf that organizes data elements and standardizes how the data elements relate to one another.

* CRUD:(Create, Read, Update, Delete) is an acronym for ways one can operate on stored data. It is a mnemonic for the four basic functions of persistent storage.

* schema: A representations of how your data is organized.

* sanitize: To clean anything from bad things. Used for security purposes, we portect the system from malicious data.

* Structured Query Language (SQL):  **relational** database that is table based, uses a structured query language and has a predefined schema.
* Non SQL (NoSQL):a **Non-relational** database, it has dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
* MongoDB: MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage. Instead of using tables and rows as in the traditional relational databases, MongoDB makes use of collections and documents

* record: 
* document:A record in a MongoDB collection is basically called a document. The document, in turn, will consist of field name and values.
* Object Relation Mapping (ORM):the idea of being able to write queries like the one above, as well as much more complicated ones, using the object-oriented paradigm of your preferred programming language.
