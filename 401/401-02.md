# Classes, Inheritance, Functional Programming

## Reading, Research, and Discussion

1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

- It provides better program design and higher code quality.
- It reduces the time required for project development because it makes the maintinence take a lot less time sine the code can be easily checked.
- Saves project costs in the long run because you have better quaility, and more maintaibable code.

2. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
- beforeEach()runs before starting the execution of each of the tests specified using “it” or “specify” in the “describe” or “context” block.
- afterEach() runs after finishing the execution of each of the tests specified using “it” or “specify” in the “describe” or “context” block.

3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development
  - It requires a lot of time and effort up front, which can make development feel slow. Source: [leantesting](https://leantesting.com/test-driven-development/)
4. What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
- A class defines a **type** definition which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance. Source: [toptal](https://www.toptal.com/javascript/es6-class-chaos-keeps-js-developer-up#:~:text=A%20child%20of%20an%20ES6,t%20implemented%20on%20the%20child.)
5. Name a use case for a static method
- prefix a method declaration with the word static inside the class declaration.
```
class Foo(){
   static methodName(){
      console.log("bar")
   }
}
```

6. Write an example of a Higher Order function and describe the use case it solves.
* A higher order function is a function that takes a function as an argument, or returns a function

``` 
function greatherThan(n){
  return m=> m > n;
}
let greatherThan10 = greterThan(10);
console.log(greatherThan10(12));
// true
```
Higher order function gives the original function a value to be used.

* functional programming: the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.

* pure function:  is a function which given the same input, will always return the same output and produces no side effects. [medium](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-pure-function-d1c076bec976)

* immutable state: Something cannot change its value or state: Source: [logrocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/immutability-in-react-ebe55253a1cc/)
* object:  a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

* object-oriented programming (OOP): a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic [Tech Target](https://searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP#:~:text=Object%2Doriented%20programming%20(OOP)%20is%20a%20computer%20programming%20model,has%20unique%20attributes%20and%20behavior.)

* class: special functions [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)
* prototype: an object that is associated with every functions and objects by default in JavaScript, where function's prototype property is accessible and modifiable and object's prototype property (aka attribute) is not visible.
Every function includes prototype object by default. Source: [tutorialsteacher](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/javascript/prototype-in-javascript#:~:text=The%20prototype%20is%20an%20object,includes%20prototype%20object%20by%20default.)
* super: a keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent Source: [ mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/super)
* inheritance:the concept of one thing gaining the properties or behaviours of something else. Source: [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5027045/what-is-inheritance-in-javascript)
* constructor: a method that is a special method of a class for creating and initializing an object of that class. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/constructor)
* instance:  an object created using a particular constructor function. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Details_of_the_Object_Model#:~:text=In%20JavaScript%2C%20%22instance%22%20does,using%20a%20particular%20constructor%20function.)
* context: always the value of the this keyword which is a reference to the object that “owns” the currently executing code. [ryanmorr](http://ryanmorr.com/understanding-scope-and-context-in-javascript/)
* this: a keyword refers to the object it belongs to. Source: [w3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_this.asp#:~:text=The%20JavaScript%20this%20keyword%20refers,on%20where%20it%20is%20used%3A&text=In%20a%20function%2C%20this%20refers,element%20that%20received%20the%20event.)
