# Express Routing and Connected API

* Routes can be managed in separate modules from the main server, allowing us to extract that logic and wiring to be more topical.

How does this change the serverâ€™s role?'


* index.js - Entry Point
* server.js - Hub, Exported Server
* models/categories.js, etc - Data Models
* routes/categories.js, etc - Routers and Handlers 

- Modules provide cleaner code and every section is easily found and managed, read, debugged and fixed.
- Testing becomes a LOT easier as you can single out certain areas to run test suites on.
