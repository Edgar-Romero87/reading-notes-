### Express routing parameters

* Express lets you run middleware only when certain parameters are present and expected.

### Sub Documents Mongoose

* Mongoose is a schema driven ORM(), which fives the oppurtunity to provide structure to our Mongo documents. By default Mongo DBs are not structured and monfoose helps with that.

* Sub dosucments are great for supportive data sucha s comments on a blog post, but they're not "populated" unless you do this manually.

### joining data/documents in Mongo.

``` populate``` is a method we can use in Mongoose to connect 2 collections.
  - Methods 1: physically joining using a reference to another collection.
  - Method 2: Virtual Population
    - create a virtual field in a document pointed to a field in another one.
    - In ```pre('find')``` you do a collection "on the fly" which can be more efficient than storing the relation.
