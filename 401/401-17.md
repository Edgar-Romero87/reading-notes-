## Review, Research and Discussion

1. Given the examples of front-end events such as button click, window resize, form submit, etc, what are some examples of back-end events?
- ticket create, ticket update note create
1. Why are events sometimes better than asynchronous actions with callbacks?
- A callback is procedure you pass as an argument to another procedure. The procedure receiving the parameter can call it, or share it so some other procedures in the system can call it.

An event handler is a procedure called when an event happens. It can be a callback.

1. What does an EventEmitter instance do?
-  a module that facilitates communication/interaction between objects in Node.

1. When is a program’s call stack, event queue, and event loop active?
- When it is activated by an asychronous event.

### TERMS
- Observer Pattern
  - a subscription model in which objects subscribe to an event and get notified when the event occurs.
  - SOURCE: [dofactory](https://www.dofactory.com/javascript/design-patterns/observer)
- Listener
  - A function that is called whenever an event of the specified type occurs.
- Event Handler
  -  a block of code (usually a JavaScript function that you as a programmer create) that runs when the event fires
- Event Driven Programming
  - the programming paradigm in the field of computer science. In this type of programming paradigm, flow of execution is determined by the events like user clicks or other programming threads or query result from database. Events are handled by event handlers or event callbacks.

- Event Loop
  - the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.
  - SOURCE: [educative](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-an-event-loop-in-javascript)
- Event Queue
  - responsible for sending new functions to the track for processing. It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution.
  - SOURCE: [educative](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-an-event-loop-in-javascript)
- Call Stack
  - responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed. Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack.

- Emit/Raise/Trigger
- Subscribe
  - subscribe itself to the observable of interest (which is getTasks() in your case) and wait until it is successful and then execute the first passed callback function
