# Node Ecosystem, TDD, CI/CD

## Reading, Research and Discussion.

### 1. Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?

 - When you run JS code outside of a browser you are able to test snippets of JS code quickly as you don't have to continously reload a webpage. This makes the development and debugging of code a lot easier and faster.

 ### 2. What is the difference between a module and a package?

 - **Modules** are libraries for Node.js. A **package** is one or more modules (libraries) grouped together.

 ### 3. What does the node package manager do?
 - It puts modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency conflicts intelligently. Most commonly, it is used to puclish, discover, install and develop node programs.

 ### 4. Provide code snippets showing 3 different ways to export a function from a node module.

 ``` 
 const getName = () => {
   return 'Jim';
 } ;

 exports.getName = getName;
 ```

 ```
 class Person {
   constructor(name, age, email){
     this.name = name;
     this.age = age;
     this.email = email;
   }

   getPErsonStats(){
     return
     NAme: ${this.name}
     Age: ${this.age}
     Email: ${this.email}
     ;
   }
 }
 module.exports = User;
 ```
