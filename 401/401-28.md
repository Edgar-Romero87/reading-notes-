2. What can be passed along in a prop variable?
  - Data
3. How can a child component “know” the state of another component?
  - props are data that are passed from a parent to its children and are made available through this.props on the child component. 


## Vocab Terms

* component props
  - When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes and children to this component as a single object. We call this object “props”.
* component state
  - The state is an instance of React Component Class can be defined as an object of a set of observable properties that control the behavior of the component. In other words, the State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component.
