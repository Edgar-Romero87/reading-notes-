# Message Queues

1. What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?
- the server can push messages to clients. Whenever you write a chat message, the idea is that the server will get it and push it to all other connected clients.
2. Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?
- a socket.io server will attach to an HTTP server so it can serve its own client code through /socket.io/socket.io.js.
3. What happens when a client emits an event?
- to create and fire custom events
4. What happens when a server emits an event?
- can send events to the send through the connection.
5. What happens if a client “misses” an event?
6. How can we mitigate this?
