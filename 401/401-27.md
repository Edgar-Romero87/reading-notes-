# Props and State

## Review, Research and Discussion

1. Does a deployed React application require a server?
  - React does not use a web server, it builds the virtual DOM and does its different operations on the client's browser.
  - SOURCE: [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26696204/does-react-js-require-server-side)
2. Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?
  - BEcause then we can test the actual interaction the user is having with the React components rather than testing what is "under the hood". 
3. What does npm run build do?
  - It lets you perform any necessary building/prep tasks for your project, prior to it being used in another project.
4. Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application
