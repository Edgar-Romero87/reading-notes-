  - two keys and their values
4. Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?

## Terms

* time travel in redux
  - the ability to move back and forth among the previous states of an application and view the results in real time. 
* action creator
  - functions that create actions.
* reducer
  -  a function that determines changes to an application’s state. It uses the action it receives to determine this change.
