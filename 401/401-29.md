# Routing

## Review, Research and Discussion

1. Do child components have direct access to props/state from the parent?

    - Yes, if a child has a prop that is because its parent provided that prop to the child.
2. When a component “wraps” another component, how does the child component’s output get rendered?
```
<Main>
  <Content />
</Main>
```
  - It will place the HTML generated by a matched route inside of a <main> DOM node.

3. Can a component, such as ```<Content />```, which is a child also be used as a standalone component elsewhere in the application?
  - Yes
4. What trick can a parent use to share all props with it’s children
  - You can use React.Children to iterate over the children, and then clone each element with new props (shallow merged) using React.cloneElement.

## Vocab
* props.children
  - It's one special prop provided by React to render something within a component whereas the component isn't aware ahead of time what it will be.
  -  A function that returns a React element. Unlike the prior two props, this will always be rendered, regardless of whether the route’s path matches the current location.

* composition
  - the internals of a function in programming that need to be arranged in a way to get the desired output.
