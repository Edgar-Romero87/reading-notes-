## Review, Research and Discussion

1. Do child components have direct access to props/state from the parent?

    - Yes, if a child has a prop that is because its parent provided that prop to the child.
2. When a component “wraps” another component, how does the child component’s output get rendered?
```
<Main>
  <Content />
</Main>
```
3. Can a component, such as <Content />, which is a child also be used as a standalone component elsewhere in the application?
4. What trick can a parent use to share all props with it’s children

## Vocab
