# Application State with Redux

1. What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”
  - Both localStorage and cookies are vulnerable to XSS attacks but it's harder for the attacker to do the attack when you're using httpOnly cookies.

2. Explain 3rd party cookies.
  - Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a website other than the one you are currently on. For example, you can have a "Like" button on your website which will store a cookie on visitor's computer, that cookie can later be accessed by Facebook to identify visitor and see which websites he visited. Such cookie is considered to be a third-party cookie.

3. How do pixel tags work?
  - a graphic with dimensions of 1x1 pixels that is loaded when a user visits a webpage or opens an email. Because it is so small, it can hardly be seen by visitors of a website or email recipients. These tracking pixels are partly or fully designed to be transparent, or camouflaged in the background color of the website so that they don't stand out to users.
